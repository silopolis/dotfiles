# To quickly log into and switch between AWS accounts in a terminal, author wrote the following script.
# It sets the AWS_PROFILE environment variable which is used by many tools that interact with the
# AWS API, like awscli or terraform.
# Author's current environment uses AzureAD as a single-sign-on provider, therefore this script uses
# aws sso login to perform an MFA login into AWS.
# The AWS profiles must be set up in such a way that aws configure list-profiles can detect them,
# which is typically done by adding them in ${AWS_CONFIG_FILE:-$HOME/.aws/config}.

# This script performs an AWS SSO login for the user-selected AWS profile
# and sets the AWS_PROFILE environment variable afterwards. To use
# this, create an alias that sources this script like this:
#
#     alias awsenv='source path/to/this/script.sh'
#
# Required software that is not in GNU coreutils:
#   - 'aws' to list profiles & get current caller identity
#   - 'fzf' to list all available AWS profiles
###############################################################################

# prompt user to select one AWS profile
profile=$(aws configure list-profiles | \
  fzf --cycle --layout=reverse --tiebreak=index)

# user can cancel switching profiles by pressing ESC
if [ -n "${profile}" ]; then
  # check if access token exists and is valid for selected profile
  if ! aws --profile "${profile}" sts get-caller-identity >/dev/null 2>&1; then
    # perform login into profile in case access token is invalid
    if ! aws sso login --profile "${profile}"; then
      # short circuit in case login failed
      return

  # AWS_PROFILE is used by many AWS-related tools
  echo "Setting AWS_PROFILE to [${profile}]"
  export AWS_PROFILE="${profile}"
  # do not expose internal variables
  unset profile
